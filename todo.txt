		- compareTo
		- toString
	ValueFileNode
		- toString
	Field
		- getFieldName
		- getFieldValue
		- equals 
			- doesn't test if "other" isn't a Field object
	RAFile
		- still being developed
	ChunkedAccess
		- set
			- doesn't check if the byte array is too long
			- doesn't check if the capacity has to double
		- isChunkPositionOutOfBounds
			- doesn't check all the paths
	IdentifierDatabase
		- addIdentifier
			- IllegalAccessError never checked
		- removeIdentifier
			- doesn't check the quick loop break
		- getAllIdentifiers
			- doesn't check the quick loop break
